Water Consumption Management and Control Project
Overview
The primary goal of this project is to leverage time series data to monitor water consumption, identify anomalies, and forecast future consumption patterns.

Project Description
In this project, we aim to address the challenge of optimizing water consumption in a building by utilizing various machine learning methodologies. The project is divided into several key phases, each focusing on a specific aspect of water consumption management:

Data Preprocessing:

Clean and prepare the raw time series data for analysis.
Handle missing values, outliers, and noise in the dataset.
Data Visualization:

Create visualizations to gain insights into the patterns and trends of water consumption.
Generate informative graphs, charts, and plots to help stakeholders understand the data.
Consumption Monitoring and Profiling:

Develop methods to monitor and profile water consumption based on historical data.
Establish baseline consumption profiles for different time periods (e.g., daily, weekly).
Anomaly Detection:

Implement anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual spikes or drops in water consumption.
Disaggregation:

Explore disaggregation techniques to break down overall water consumption into individual sources (e.g., faucets, toilets).
Enable more granular monitoring and control of water usage.
Time Series Forecasting:

Utilize time series forecasting models to predict future water consumption patterns.

Conclusion
This Water Consumption Management and Control Project aims to harness the power of machine learning and data analysis to achieve efficient water usage within a building. By effectively preprocessing data, visualizing consumption patterns, detecting anomalies, and forecasting future trends, we aspire to make a positive impact on water conservation and resource optimization.
